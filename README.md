### What I learned

When you advance in your knowledge of Web Development you forget things (that can be remembered again in Google) and this is my case with CSS. Reinforced knowledge:

- Make an image fit its container:

I know, basic. But I didn't remember it well. With these styles you will make the image adapt to any size of the container and also give it a maximum size.
```css
img {
  width: 100%;
  max-width: 250px;
}
```

### Useful resources

- [MDN - CSS Documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/es/docs/Learn/CSS) - As with HTML, Mozilla has excellent CSS documentation, don't forget to take a look.
